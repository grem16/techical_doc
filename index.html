          <p>Welcome to the official FastHTML documentation.</p>
          <p>
            FastHTML is a new next-generation web framework for fast, scalable
            web applications with minimal, compact code. It’s designed to be:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Powerful and expressive enough to build the most advanced,
              interactive web apps you can imagine.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fast and lightweight, so you can write less code and get more
              done.
            </li>
            <li>
              Easy to learn and use, with a simple, intuitive syntax that makes
              it easy to build complex apps quickly.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            FastHTML is just Python. You can install it with pip install
            python-fasthtml. Extensions/components built for it can likewise be
            distributed via PyPI or as simple Python files.
          </p>
          <p>
            The core usage of FastHTML is to define routes, and then to define
            what to do at each route. This is similar to the FastAPI web
            framework (in fact we implemented much of the functionality to match
            the FastAPI usage examples), but where FastAPI focuses on returning
            JSON data to build APIs, FastHTML focuses on returning HTML data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here’s a simple FastHTML app that returns a “Hello, World” message:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
    from fasthtml.common import FastHTML, serve

    app = FastHTML()

    @app.get("/")
    def home():
    return "&lt;h1&gt;Hola Mundo&lt;/h1&gt;"

    serve()
              </code>
          </pre>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Constructing_HTML">
        <header>Constructing HTML</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Notice we wrote some HTML in the previous example. We don’t want to
            do that! Some web frameworks require that you learn HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript AND some templating language AND python. We want to do as
            much as possible with just one language. Fortunately, the Python
            module fastcore.xml has all we need for constructing HTML from
            Python, and FastHTML includes all the tags you need to get started.
            For example:
          </p>
          <pre><code>
    from fasthtml.common import *
    page = Html(
    Head(Title('Some page')),
    Body(Div('Some text, ', A('A link', href='https://example.com'), Img(src="https://placehold.co/200"), cls='myclass')))
    print(to_xml(page))
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            FastHTML is smart enough to know about fastcore.xml, and so you
            don’t need to use the to_xml function to convert your FT objects to
            HTML. You can just return them as you would any other Python object.
            For example, if we modify our previous example to use fastcore.xml,
            we can return an FT object directly:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
    from fasthtml.common import *
    app = FastHTML()

    @app.get("/")
    def home():
        page = Html(
            Head(Title('Some page')),
            Body(Div('Some text, ', A('A link', href='https://example.com'), Img(src="https://placehold.co/200"), cls='myclass')))
        return page

    serve()
            </code>
          </pre>

          <p>
            The HTTP protocol defines a number of methods (‘verbs’) to send
            requests to a server. The most common are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,
            and HEAD. We saw ‘GET’ in action before - when you navigate to a
            URL, you’re making a GET request to that URL. We can do different
            things on a route for different HTTP methods. For example:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
    @app.route("/", methods='get')
    def home():
        return H1('Hello, World')

    @app.route("/", methods=['post', 'put'])
    def post_or_put():
        return "got a POST or PUT request"
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            This says that when someone navigates to the root URL “/” (i.e.
            sends a GET request), they will see the big “Hello, World” heading.
            When someone submits a POST or PUT request to the same URL, the
            server should return the string “got a post or put request”.
          </p>

            Plain HTML probably isn’t quite what you imagine when you visualize
            your beautiful web app. CSS is the go-to language for styling HTML.
            But again, we don’t want to learn extra languages unless we
            absolutely have to! Fortunately, there are ways to get much more
            visually appealing sites by relying on the hard work of others,
            using existing CSS libraries. One of our favourites is PicoCSS. A
            common way to add CSS files to web pages is to use a &lt;link /&gt;
            tag inside your HTML header, like this:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
    &lt;header&gt;
        ...
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@picocss/pico@latest/css/pico.min.css"&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Since we typically want CSS styling on all pages of our app,
            FastHTML lets you define a shared HTML header with the hdrs argument
            as shown below:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
    from fasthtml.common import *
    css = Style(':root {--pico-font-size:90%,--pico-font-family: Pacifico, cursive;}')
    app = FastHTML(hdrs=(picolink, css))

    @app.route("/")
    def get():
        return (Title("Hello World"), 
            Main(H1('Hello, World'), cls="container"))
            </code>
          </pre>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Web_Page_to_Web_App">
        <header>Web Page to Web App</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Showing content is all well and good, but we typically expect a bit
            more interactivity from something calling itself a web app! So,
            let’s add a few different pages, and use a form to let users add
            messages to a list:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
    app = FastHTML()
    messages = ["This is a message, which will get rendered as a paragraph"]
    
    @app.get("/")
    def home():
        return Main(H1('Messages'), 
                    *[P(msg) for msg in messages],
                    A("Link to Page 2 (to add messages)", href="/page2"))
    
    @app.get("/page2")
    def page2():
        return Main(P("Add a message with the form below:"),
                    Form(Input(type="text", name="data"),
                            Button("Submit"),
                            action="/", method="post"))
    
    @app.post("/")
    def add_message(data:str):
        messages.append(data)
        return home()                
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            We re-render the entire homepage to show the newly added message.
            This is fine, but modern web apps often don’t re-render the entire
            page, they just update a part of the page. In fact even very
            complicated applications are often implemented as ‘Single Page Apps’
            (SPAs). This is where HTMX comes in.
          </p>

          <p>
            HTMX addresses some key limitations of HTML. In vanilla HTML, links
            can trigger a GET request to show a new page, and forms can send
            requests containing data to the server. A lot of ‘Web 1.0’ design
            revolved around ways to use these to do everything we wanted. But
            why should only some elements be allowed to trigger requests? And
            why should we refresh the entire page with the result each time one
            does? HTMX extends HTML to allow us to trigger requests from any
            element on all kinds of events, and to update a part of the page
            without refreshing the entire page. It’s a powerful tool for
            building modern web apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            It does this by adding attributes to HTML tags to make them do
            things. For example, here’s a page with a counter and a button that
            increments it:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
    app = FastHTML()

    count = 0

    @app.get("/")
    def home():
        return Title("Count Demo"), Main(
            H1("Count Demo"),
            P(f"Count is set to {count}", id="count"),
            Button("Increment", hx_post="/increment", hx_target="#count", hx_swap="innerHTML")
        )

    @app.post("/increment")
    def increment():
        print("incrementing")
        global count
        count += 1
        return f"Count is set to {count}"
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            The button triggers a POST request to /increment (since we set
            hx_post="/increment"), which increments the count and returns the
            new count. The hx_target attribute tells HTMX where to put the
            result. If no target is specified it replaces the element that
            triggered the request. The hx_swap attribute specifies how it adds
            the result to the page. Useful options are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              innerHTML: Replace the target element’s content with the result.
            </li>
            <li>outerHTML: Replace the target element with the result.</li>
            <li>beforebegin: Insert the result before the target element.</li>
            <li>
              beforeend: Insert the result inside the target element, after its
              last child.
            </li>
            <li>
              afterbegin: Insert the result inside the target element, before
              its first child.
            </li>
            <li>afterend: Insert the result after the target element.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Replacing_Elements">
        <header>Replacing Elements</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Sometimes having a single target is not enough, and we’d like to
            specify some additional elements to update or remove. In these
            cases, returning elements with an id that matches the element to be
            replaced and hx_swap_oob='true' will replace those elements too.
            We’ll use this in the next example to clear an input field when we
            submit a form.
